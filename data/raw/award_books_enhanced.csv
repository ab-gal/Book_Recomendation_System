The Américas Award,Laretta Henderson,Bloomsbury Publishing PLC,2015-12-16,"First awarded in 1993, the Américas Award is given in recognition of books that authentically and engagingly portray Latino/as in Latin America, the Caribbean or the United States.

The Award is unique in that selects Latino/a youth literature for classroom use and in that it focuses on the entire Western Hemisphere. Scholars from the fields of literature, education, lbrary science, and theater engage with Latino/a Critical Race Theory (LatCrit) in this ecollection of essays about the Américas Award, the Award-winning and honored books, and the contexts in which the books are used.

Critical Perspectives on Postcolonial African Children's and Young Adult Literature,Meena Khorana,Praeger,1998-04-08,"The past few years mark a growing scholarly interest in African children's literature in the United States. Several books have recently been published on the subject, and the number of papers on African children's literature presented at conferences or published in scholarly journals also seems to have increased. These publications are becoming more and more sophisticated as scholars move away from general country surveys or analyses of publishing conditions and instead analyze literary structures, themes, and illustrations, or apply Marxist, feminist, or postcolonial theories to interpret literary works. The question of an authentic voice in postcolonial African children's literature has emerged as a central concern to those who care about books for African children and young adults. Also of importance is the matter of how Africa is presented in literature for children who do not live on that continent. The essays in this book either take a postcolonial or revisionist approach to the study of colonial literature, or discuss books published after decolonization. The introductory essay provides a general analysis of the key issues facing the publication of children's books in postcolonial Africa—issues of national identity, language, appropriate genres, and relevant themes to inculcate a nationalistic outlook in children and young adults. The chapters that follow are located within this broad framework and are written by expert contributors. While these essays reflect the scholarly interests and specialization of each author, they also span the entire field of African children's literature. The first group of chapters surveys African children's literature from a variety of angles and explores such topics as literacy and the publishing culture in Africa, the role and importance of awards, Nigerian young adult literature, and the relevance of folktales. The book then turns to a discussion of books about Africa written by Western authors for Western readers, which often project values and perspectives that betray a continuing colonial bias. The last part of the book examines more specialized themes and concerns.",Literary Criticism,202.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=y6xkAAAAMAAJ&q=awarded+books&dq=awarded+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=42&source=gbs_api,,

Essentials of Young Adult Literature,"Carl M. Tomlinson, Carol Lynch-Brown",Allyn & Bacon,2007,"""Essentials of Young Adult Literature"" Based on a genre approach to literature, this long-awaited book offers a comprehensive, clear, and succinct overview of adolescent literature. It includes recommended books listed by genre and topic, and engages readers by offering a thorough discussion of the major trends and issues affecting young adult literature such as censorship, the literary canon, and accountability. It provides clearly stated positions on the current issues affecting schools and literature. Written by well-known authors Carl Tomlinson and Carol Lynch-Brown, ""Essentials of Young Adult Literature"" places emphasis on reading a wide variety of young adult literature and addresses all types and formats of literature including novels, short stories, graphic novels, and picture books for older readers. In addition, notable authors are featured in each genre chapter and multicultural and international literature is integrated throughout the book and then treated more fully in its own chapter. Current and future teachers will appreciate the authors' practical strategies for connecting secondary school students with young adult books, such as how to select books that students will read and enjoy, how to motivate resistant readers to read, and how to develop text sets for classroom study across the curriculum. Readers will be equipped with the knowledge to use trade books as excellent teaching and learning materials and will not be limited to using textbooks alone. Key Features ""Literature Across the Curriculum"" features found in all genre chapters give examples of how young adult literature can help students and teachers in the content areas learn or present course content in a more interesting, memorable way. Extensive lists of recommended books briefly annotated with topics and age levels follow each genre chapter.

Inside the Nobel Prize,Jasmine Dyggan,Independently Published,2025-12-02,"Inside the Nobel Prize invites readers into one of the most extraordinary traditions in modern history-an award born from invention, controversy, and an unexpected act of legacy. More than a century after the first medals were presented, the Nobel Prize remains the world's most famous recognition of human achievement, celebrating brilliance in science, literature, peace, and the pursuit of knowledge that makes life better for everyone. This book reveals the remarkable story behind the prize, beginning with the life of Alfred Nobel-a restless genius who held over 350 patents, revolutionised engineering with the invention of dynamite, and wrestled with the moral weight of how his creations were used. A mistaken obituary branding him ""the merchant of death"" forced Nobel to examine how history might remember him, inspiring a decision that shocked his family and changed the world: to leave his vast fortune to establish five annual prizes that would honour those who brought the ""greatest benefit to mankind."" From the dramatic legal battle to bring Nobel's will to life, to the first awards in 1901, this book uncovers the surprising and inspiring details behind each chapter of the Nobel story. You'll explore how the original five prize categories were chosen, why the Peace Prize is awarded in Oslo rather than Stockholm, how winners are selected through one of the most secretive processes on Earth, and the riches and recognition that await each Laureate. You'll also learn how a sixth prize-Economic Sciences-was added decades later, revealing how the Nobel legacy continues to evolve. Along the way, Inside the Nobel Prize highlights the extraordinary individuals who have shaped history as Laureates: scientists who unlocked the mysteries of life, writers who reshaped world literature, and leaders whose courage advanced the cause of peace. Their stories reflect humanity's greatest challenges and triumphs, showing why the Nobel Prize remains a beacon of progress and hope. Perfect for curious readers of all ages, this book offers a clear, engaging journey through the history of the world's most prestigious award. It answers essential questions-Who created the Nobel Prize? Why is it awarded? What makes it so special?-while revealing the human stories behind the medals, the mysteries behind the ceremonies, and the ideas that continue to inspire the world. Inside the Nobel Prize is a celebration of curiosity, courage, creativity, and the belief that ideas can change the world.",Biography & Autobiography,0.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=PmvG0QEACAAJ&dq=awarded+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=288&source=gbs_api,,
For Gallantry,Craig Blanch,NewSouth,2021-05-12,"From the frozen wastes of Antarctica to the burning ruins of the Bali bombings, For Gallantry tells the stories of the 28 Australians awarded the nation's highest non-combat awards for bravery: the Imperial George Cross and its Australian Honours and Awards replacement, the Cross of Valour. Created to mark extraordinary deeds away from the field of battle, the awards are the non-combat equivalent of the coveted Victoria Cross. More than a quarter of the recipients were awarded posthumously -- testimony to the selflessness recognised by the decorations. They came from all walks of life. From teachers and farmers to defence force members and firefighters, theirs are stories of incredible physical and moral courage. Some were recognised for single heroic acts, others for their conduct over many months of terrible adversity. With assistance from the sole surviving Australian holder of the George Cross, and recipients of the Cross of Valour, For Gallantry profiles their heroic actions in a dedicated volume for the first time. 'Courageous behaviour comes in many forms. For Gallantry tells the remarkable true stories of some of Australia's most selfless people. A beautifully illustrated work that keeps you captivated from the first page.' -- Dan Keighran VC",History,192.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=ATGWzQEACAAJ&dq=awarded+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=289&source=gbs_api,,

Academy Award Winning Sisters,Charles River Editors,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2014-04-15,"*Includes pictures. *Includes both actresses' quotes about each other and their careers. *Includes a bibliography for further reading. ""Famous people feel that they must perpetually be on the crest of the wave, not realising that it is against all the rules of life. You can't be on top all the time, it isn't natural."" - Olivia de Havilland ""You know, I've had a helluva life. Not just the acting part. I've flown in an international balloon race. I've piloted my own plane. I've ridden to the hounds. I've done a lot of exciting things."" - Joan Fontaine Olivia de Havilland is one of the last few living actresses who worked during the Golden Era of Hollywood, but also one of the most decorated, winning dozens of awards over the course of a 50 year career. Among those, she most notably won the Academy Award for Best Actress for To Each His Own (1946) and The Heiress (1949), more than a decade after she got her start as an 18 year old in Hollywood. Ironically, de Havilland was in California in part because the young British girl who had been born in Tokyo stopped in the States for medical treatment. Of course, de Havilland isn't well remembered for any of those accolades or other movies but because she played Melanie Hamilton in Gone With the Wind (1939), perhaps the most famous movie in American history. Although she was a veteran actress at the time, de Havilland's career hadn't progressed much since she started, and rumor has it that she eventually got the role after her own sister, Joan Fontaine, was asked to audition for the part and recommended Olivia instead. Olivia was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and became a household name in her adopted country overnight. Having been typecast in light romantic comedies before Gone With the Wind, that performance ensured de Havilland subsequently had a long, productive and versatile career making everything from Westerns and dramas. Of those movies, she is perhaps most closely associated with the enigmatic Errol Flynn, another foreign-born actor who was more notorious for his roles off the screen than on it. Before his untimely death, they appeared in several films together and became one of Hollywood's most popular on-screen couples. Although Fontaine and de Havilland would make history by becoming the only sisters to both win an Academy Award for Best Actress, that anecdote was just one of the various stories about the siblings that has shed light on their notoriously contentious and complicated relationship. As Fontaine once put it, ""I married first, won the Oscar before Olivia did, and if I die first, she'll undoubtedly be livid because I beat her to it!"" De Havilland herself once said, ""Joan is very bright and sharp and can be cutting."" Of course, one of the reasons people have remained interested in the sisters is that both of them had such long acting careers, and Fontaine became best remembered both for a career that spanned 60 years and several high profile marriages. With typical humor, Fontaine joked about the fact she had so many husbands, commenting in jest, ""If you keep marrying as I do, you learn everybody's hobby."" But that attention has only served to obscure her very serious professional career, which saw her won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion (1941). She also earned a nomination for her performance in The Constant Nymph (1943), and in a television career that spanned several decades, she earned an Emmy nomination for her work on Ryan's Hope in 1980, nearly 40 years after winning the Academy Award for Suspicion. Fontaine even appeared on Broadway in a couple of productions that ran for several years. This book profiles the life and career of two of Hollywood's most prolific actresses. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the sisters like never before.",Motion picture actors and actresses,0.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=3dj8oAEACAAJ&dq=awarded+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=293&source=gbs_api,,

Chapters: List of winners of the National Book Award, National Book Award for Fiction, National Book Award for Nonfiction, National Book Award for Poetry, National Book Award for Young People's Literature, National Book Foundation. Excerpt: The National Book Award for Nonfiction is one of four annual National Book Awards, which are given by the National Book Foundation to recognize outstanding literary work by U.S. citizens. They are awards ""by writers to writers."" The panelists are five ""writers who are known to be doing great work in their genre or field."" The original National Book Awards recognized the ""Most Distinguished"" biography and nonfiction books (two) of 1935 and 1936, and the ""Favorite"" nonfiction books of 1937 to 1940. The ""Bookseller Discovery"" and the ""Most Original Book"" sometimes recognized nonfiction. (See below.) The general ""Nonfiction"" award was one of three when the National Book Awards were re-established in 1950 for 1949 publications, which the National Book Foundation considers the origin of its current Awards series. From 1964 to 1983, under different administrators, there were multiple nonfiction categories. The current Nonfiction award recognizes one book written by a US citizen and published in the US from December 1 to November 30. The National Book Foundation accepts nominations from publishers until June 15, requires mailing nominated books to the panelists by August 1, and announces five finalists in October. The winner is announced on the day of the final ceremony in November. The award is $10,000 and a bronze sculpture; other finalists get $1000, a medal, and a citation written by the panel. The sculpture by Louise Nevelson dates from the 1980 awards. The $10,000 and $1000 cash prizes and autumn recognition for current-year publications date from 1984.

Remember the training: find shelter or make shelter, remain in place, establish contact with other members of the party, keep moving, keep calm. Robert 'Doc' Wright, a veteran of Antarctic surveying, was there on the ice when the worst happened. He holds within him the complete story of that night—but depleted by the disaster, Wright is no longer able to communicate the truth. Instead, in the wake of the catastrophic expedition, he faces the most daunting adventure of his life: learning a whole new way to be in the world. Meanwhile Anna, his wife, must suddenly scramble to navigate the sharp and unexpected contours of life as a caregiver. From the Booker Prize-longlisted, American Academy of Arts & Letters Award-winning author of Reservoir 13, this is a novel every bit as mesmerizing as its setting. Tenderly unraveling different notions of heroism through the rippling effects of one extraordinary expedition on an ordinary family, Lean Fall Stand explores the indomitable human impulse to turn our experiences into stories—even when the words may fail us.",Fiction,289.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=VMIXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=award-winning+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=247&source=gbs_api,,

Fierce September,Fleur Beale,Penguin Random House New Zealand Limited,2010-12-01,"Juno of Taris faces more dangers in the second in the award-winning science fiction / fantasy young adult novel series. Juno and the Taris inhabitants must leave their dying island. The young people look forward to a wider life Outside, but Outside too has its problems. It is two-year-old Hera, with her uncanny ability to foresee events, who saves the Taris people from the injury and death prepared for them by an underground group of protestors. The people of Taris, though, have no choice but to try to live in this seemingly hostile place. The young people are entranced despite the hate campaign against them: there are the fashions, the technologies and best of all for Juno, the freedom from extreme control. Only days after the group arrives, a pandemic hits the country - this has drastic consequences for Juno and her people. Once the pandemic is over, life settles down and the question now for Juno is to find her way among the choices open to her, some of which cause her parents to fear she is abandoning the values they hold so dear. Juno was relieved to put Taris behind her. But Taris doesn't give up its hold so easily - she is shocked to find the island held more secrets than any of them knew. She wants to bury her head, ignore what she's discovered and forge ahead to find her own place in this new world. She falls for Ivan, a young man who seems to understand her, but love is a fey thing. What will become of her?

Award-Winning Finalist of the 2020 USA Best Book Awards—Fiction Inspirational! Award-Winning Finalist of the 2020 International Book Awards—Inspirational Fiction! Film follows three women who moved to Los Angeles to pursue their dreams. Tash Daniels aspires to be a filmmaker. Her short film was rejected from festivals, she has a stack of rejected grant proposals, and she lost her internship at a studio when her boss harassed her, forcing her to take a job as a personal shopper. Lu K is a hot deejay slowly working her way up the club scene, but no one is doing her any favors. Fiercely independent, she’s at a loss when she meets Paisley, a woman who captures her heart. Monroe Preston is the glamorous wife of a Hollywood studio head. As a teenager she moved to LA in search of a “big” life, but now she wonders if reality measures up to fantasy. When a man in their circle finds sudden fame, each of these women is catapulted on a journey of self-discovery. As the characters’ stories unfold, each is forced to confront how her past has shaped her fears and to choose how she wants to live in the present. Film is a novel about the underside of dreams, the struggle to find internal strength, the power of art, and what it truly means to live a “big” life. Frequently shown bathed in the glow of the silver screen, the characters in Film show us how the arts can reignite the light within. With a tribute to popular culture, set against the backdrop of Tinseltown, Film celebrates how the art we make and consume can shape our stories, scene by scene. Although fictional, Film is loosely grounded in interview research. It can be read entirely for pleasure or used as supplemental reading in a variety of courses in women’s studies/gender studies, sociology, psychology, communication, popular culture, media studies, or qualitative inquiry.

Award Winning Australian Writing,Adolfo Aranjuez,,2013,"The sixth edition of Award Winning Australian Writing (AWAW) continues its commitment to showcasing the best short stories and poems that have won competitions around the country. Much like the 2012 anthology, this year's collection will feature over fifty writers and competitions. It will also proudly include a foreword by Carmel Bird, in honour of whom Spineless Wonders runs the Carmel Bird Short Fiction Award. Bird is the author of nine literary novels, six collections of short fiction and three books on the art of writing.

The critic Matthew Lamb, in The Australian, commended the ""invaluable service"" AWAW offers to the literary community, while in The Age reviewer Lorien Kaye celebrates that AWAW gives readers a chance ""to value these winners"". Similar sentiments are expressed by author Irma Gold, who wrote in Overland that AWAW is ""a must read"" and The Advertiser critic Patrick Allington, who praised the ""impressive new voices"" and ""energy and inventiveness"" collected in the book. Most recently, Lip magazine praises the way AWAW ""acts as a panoramic snapshot of the writing industry"", and ArtsHub reviewer Oliver Mol noted that AWAW ""proves that there are writers in this country pushing boundaries and exploring literature in modern ways"". The 2013 edition will feature the work of both emerging and established authors, such as Susan McCreery, Kevin Gillam, Jack Vening, Chloe Wilson, Barry Divola and Joanne Anderton. Heavyweights gracing AWAW 2013's pages include Felicity Volk, author of the forthcoming Lightning (Picador, 2013); Angela Meyer, writer, blogger and a judge for the Carmel Bird Award; Margo Lanagan, multi-award-winning author (including four 2013 Aurealis awards); renowned poet John A.

Did you know that pictures can sometimes inspire stories, rather than the other way around? From Quentin Blake’s drawings of fantastical vehicles to Michael Rosen’s inside look at his poetry, from Anthony Browne’s shape game (no need to be an artist to play) to Lauren Child’s look at her creative process, this anthology — whose contributors were all British Children’s Laureates — aims to encourage budding writers and artists to let their imaginations soar.

Hugh Grant Adult Coloring Book,Elizabeth Holmes,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,2018-03-12,"This is work of creative art and satire (17 U.S. Code § 107) Within the film industry, Grant is cited as an anti-star who approaches his roles like a character actor, and attempts to make his acting appear spontaneous. Hallmarks of his comic skills include a nonchalant touch of irony/sarcasm and studied physical mannerisms, as well as his precisely-timed dialogue delivery and facial expressions. The entertainment media's coverage of Grant's life off the big screen has often overshadowed his work as an actor. Grant has been outspoken about his antipathy towards the profession of acting, and in his disdain towards the culture of celebrity and hostility towards the media. In a career spanning 30 years, Grant has repeatedly claimed that acting was not his true calling, but rather a career that developed by happenstance.[",,44.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=BKJpswEACAAJ&dq=award-winning+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=290&source=gbs_api,,

These are intense and private lives made public by the force of their individual voices, voices that may be rambunctious and fractious but that are, nonetheless, elegant in their intent and humor and their acceptance that is never acquiescence.

The Passage of Love,Alex Miller,Allen & Unwin,2017-10-25,"A thoughtful autobiographical work by an award-winning Australian novelist...traces themes of art and commitment through Crofts' relationships with three women. Miller pulls back from the narrative several times in interludes that return to the first person of the much older man and highlight how memory has many layers. A rich addition to the growing shelf of autofiction from a seasoned storyteller.' Kirkus, starred review Sitting in a New York park, an old man holds a book and tries to accept that his contribution to the future is over. Instead, he remembers a youthful yearning for open horizons, for Australia, a yearning he now knows inspired his life as a writer. Instinctively he picks up his pen and starts at the beginning... At twenty-one years, Robert Crofts leaves his broken dreams in Far North Queensland, finally stopping in Melbourne almost destitute. It's there he begins to understand how books and writing might be the saving of him. They will be how he leaves his mark on the world. He also begins to understand how many obstacles there will be to thwart his ambition. When Robert is introduced to Lena Soren, beautiful, rich and educated, his life takes a very different path. But in the intimacy of their connection lies an unknowability that both torments and tantalises as Robert and Lena long for something that neither can provide for the other. In a rich blend of thoughtful and beautifully observed writing, the lives of a husband and wife are laid bare in their passionate struggle to engage with their individual creativity. Alex Miller is magnificent in this most personal of all novels filled with rare wisdom and incisive observation.

Coetzee's latest novel, The Schooldays of Jesus, is now available from Viking. Late Essays: 2006-2016 will be available January 2018. Nobel Prize-winning author J. M. Coetzee's new book follows a young biographer as he works on a book about the late writer, John Coetzee. The biographer embarks on a series of interviews with people who were important to Coetzee during the period when he was ""finding his feet as a writer""-in his thirties and sharing a run-down cottage in the suburbs of Cape Town with his widowed father. Their testimonies create an image of an awkward, reserved, and bookish young man who finds it difficult to connect with the people around him.

Shooting the Fox,Marion Halligan,Allen & Unwin,2011-06-01,"On love and loss, sex and death, food and gardening . a new collection by Australia's most assured short-story writer. 'Why did Bluebeard kill his wives? Because that's what he did. It's a given. It's the plot. Until the lucky one, who is saved. The even more interesting question is: why did Mrs Bluebeard feel utterly unable to resist opening the door? Don't we all think, when it comes to these stories, that we'd have made it work? So much freedom, and one tiny forbidden thing. Not important, a token in fact. So easy to obey so small a prohibition. We think, if I had been Eve I wouldn't have picked the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, I wouldn't have given a piece to Adam. I and my progeny down the millennia would still be multiplying fruitfully in the Garden of Eden.' Life in all its richness is reflected in this superb new collection from one of Australia's most acclaimed short story writers. Love and loss, sex and death, and the great pleasures of food, wine and reading all populate its pages. Shooting the Fox is brimming with surprising characters - the virgin and the pornographer, the adulterer, the translator, the defecting diplomat - and the inconveniences of modernity. In the end, though, it is a collection of stories about happiness, its circuitous routes, its surprising outcomes, and the consequences when we fail in its pursuit.",Fiction,235.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=97c7zaGnRCUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=220&source=gbs_api,,

Thunder and Light,Marie-Claire Blais,House of Anansi,2018-08-04,"The second volume in the beloved novelist Marie-Claire Blais’s prize-winning novel cycle — acclaimed as one of the greatest undertakings in modern Quebec fiction — reissued in a handsome A List edition. Originally published in 2001, Thunder and Light is the second volume in Marie-Claire Blais’s prize-winning Soifs series, hailed as one of the greatest undertakings in modern Quebec fiction. Powered by its characters’ gripping exploration of the world’s dark corners, the novel is a teeming microcosm in which boundaries collapse and the extremes and contradictions that animate our times are reconciled. Blais locks us directly into the consciousness of her characters, many of whom we met in her previous novel, These Festive Nights, and many that she derives from actual news stories: Jessica, a seven-year-old attempting to beat the world record as the youngest pilot to cross the continent; Nathanaël, a teenager on death row for killing his favourite teacher; Our Lady of the Bags, a modern-day Joan of Arc who lives among Manhattan’s skyscrapers and follows the voices in her head; and Caroline and Jean-Mathieu, aging artists who are fighting to come together again. One character’s thoughts or actions have consequences for another 3,000 miles away who is a complete stranger to the first. This is an intricate house of cards, delicately but expertly constructed, that shocks us in its perversity and familiarity, ultimately finding hope and redemption in the most human and basic forms of art.",Fiction,198.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=66-aDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=244&source=gbs_api,,
Incommunicado,Randall Platt,Simon and Schuster,2014-11-04,"Just about everyone is incommunicado in the small, sleepy Oregon coastal town of Sea Park during winter. Until Pearl Harbor, that is, when it springs to patriotic life. But is Ruby Opal Pearl (a.k.a. Jewels) Stokes the only person to see what’s really happening here? Tommy Kasamoto, the one person in her life who has provided security, shelter, and a smidgeon of respect—and who owns the biggest resort on the coast—is now the cause of the town’s rage. Tommy’s Japanese ancestry makes him the prime target of an angry mob, not to mention he’s also rich, has a shady past, and everyone in town owes him money. As the town's patriotism blossoms into paranoia and turns violent, Jewels has to do something to protect Tommy from internment (or worse), even if that something is going up against the town and the government, not to mention the FBI. Thus begins a fourteen-year-old girl’s war within a war. Randall Platt’s Incommunicado is both timely and timeless. It's about the meaning of courage and the willingness to stand up for what's right, even when it goes against the prevailing attitudes of the time and place. It's also about the insidious way groups and communities can nurture ignorance and prejudice. But most of all, it’s an adventure story set in a town full of unforgettable characters, during a time of great intrigue and peril, no matter which enemy or on what front you fight.

The Lost Life,Steven Carroll,HarperCollins Australia,2012-12-18,"A story about love, chance and T.S. Eliot. England, September 1934. Two young lovers, Catherine and Daniel, have trespassed into the rose garden of Burnt Norton, an abandoned house in the English countryside. Hearing the sound of footsteps, they hide, and then witness the poet T.S. ('Tom') Eliot and his close friend Emily enter the garden and bury a mysterious tin in the earth.

A Russian Sister,Caroline Adderson,HarperCollins Publishers,2022-09-15,"In this witty and colourfully peopled novel, Caroline Adderson effortlessly plunges the reader into a nineteenth-century Russian tragicomedy. Aspiring painter Masha C. is blindly devoted to Antosha, her famous writer-brother. Through the years Antosha takes up with numerous women from Masha's circle of friends, yet none of these relationships threaten the siblings' close ties until the winter he falls into a depression. Then Masha invites into their Moscow home a young woman who teaches with her--the beautiful, vivacious and deeply vulnerable Lika Mizanova--with the express hope she might help Antosha recover. The appearance of Lika sets off a convolution of unrequited love, jealousy and scandal that lasts for seven years. If the famously unattainable writer has lost his heart to Lika as everyone claims, why does he undertake a life-threatening voyage to Sakhalin Island? And what will happen to Masha if she is demoted from ""woman of the house"" to ""spinster sister""? While Antosha and Lika push and pull, Masha falls in love herself--with a man and with a mongoose--only to have her dreams crushed twice. From her own heartbreak Masha comes to recognize the harm that she has done to her friends by encouraging their involvement with Antosha, but it is too late for Lika, who will both sacrifice herself for love and be immortalized as the model for Nina in Chekhov's The Seagull. A Russian Sister offers a clever commentary on the role of women as prey for male needs and inspiration, a role they continue to play today. At the same time the novel is a plea for sisterhood, both familial and friendly. Chekhov's The Seagull changed the theatre. A Russian Sister gives the reader a glimpse behind the curtain to the fascinating real-life people who inspired it and the tragedy that followed its premiere.",,384.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=0zkgzgEACAAJ&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=250&source=gbs_api,,

Literary Occasions,V S Naipaul,Picador,2004-02-01,"From a master of the English language comes this astonishing collection of essays about reading, writing, and identity. In these eleven extended pieces V. S. Naipaul charts more than half a century of personal enquiry into the mysteries of the written word and of fiction in particular. Here are his boyhood experiences of reading books and his first youthful efforts at writing them; the evolution of his ideas about the extent to which individual cultures shape identities and influence literary forms; observations on Conrad, his literary forebear; the moving preface he wrote to the only book his father ever published; and his reflections on his career, ending with his celebrated Nobel lecture, 'Two Worlds'. A remarkable companion piece to The Writer and the World, Naipaul's previous volume of highly acclaimed essays, Literary Occasions is a stirring contribution to the fading art of the critic, and a revelation of a life in letters.",Literary Collections,220.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=JkfU4I5y8ogC&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=285&source=gbs_api,,
Rohzin,Rahman Abbas,Vintage Books,2022-08-15,"Mumbai was almost submerged on the fatal noon of 26 July 2005, when the merciless downpour and cloudburst had spread utter darkness and horror in the heart of the city. River Mithi was inundated, and the sea was furious. At this hour of torturous gloom, Rohzin begins declaring in the first line that it was the last day in the life of two lovers, Asrar and Hina. The novel's protagonist, Asrar, comes to Mumbai, and through his eyes the author describes the hitherto-unknown aspects of Mumbai, unseen colours and unseen secrets of the city's underbelly. The love story of Asar and Hina begins abruptly and ends tragically. It is love at first sight which takes place in the premises of Haji Ali Dargah. The arc of the novel studies various aspects of human emotions, especially love, longing and sexuality as sublime expressions. The emotions are examined, so is love as well as the absence of it, through a gamut of characters and their interrelated lives: Asrar's relationship with his teacher, Ms Jamila, a prostitute named Shanti and, later, with Hina; Hina's classmate Vidhi's relations with her lover and others; Hina's father Yusuf's love for Aymal; Vanu's indulgence in prostitutes. Rohzin dwells on the plane of an imagination that takes readers on a unique journey across the city of Mumbai, a highly intriguing character in its own right.",Fiction,256.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=3M_3zgEACAAJ&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=286&source=gbs_api,,

Sleeping on Jupiter,Anuradha Roy,MacLehose Press,2015-04-02,"LONGLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2015 A stark and unflinching novel by a spellbinding storyteller, about religion, love and violence in the modern world. A train stops at a railway station. A young woman jumps off. She has wild hair, sloppy clothes, a distracted air. She looks Indian, yet she is somehow not. The sudden violence of what happens next leaves the other passengers gasping. The train terminates at Jarmuli, a temple town by the sea. Here, among pilgrims, priests and ashrams, three old women disembark only to encounter the girl once again. What is someone like her doing in this remote corner, which attracts only worshippers? Over the next five days, the old women live out their long-planned dream of a holiday together; their temple guide finds ecstasy in forbidden love; and the girl is joined by a photographer battling his own demons. The full force of the evil and violence beneath the serene surface of the town becomes evident when their lives overlap and collide. Unexpected connections are revealed between devotion and violence, friendship and fear, as Jarmuli is revealed as a place with a long, dark past that transforms all who encounter it.",Fiction,230.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=PgzxCgAAQBAJ&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=288&source=gbs_api,,

Historical Dictionary of Asian American Literature and Theater,Wenying Xu,Bloomsbury Publishing USA,2012-04-12,"Asian American literature is one of the most recent forms of ethnic literature and is already becoming one of the most prominent, given the large number of writers, the growing ethnic population from the region, the general receptivity of this body of work, and the quality of the authors. In recent decades, there has been an exponential growth in their output and much Asian American literature has now achieved new levels of popular success and critical acclaim. Nurtured by rich and long literary traditions from the vast continent of Asia, this literature is poised between the ancient and the modern, between the East and West, and between the oral and the written. The Historical Dictionary of Asian American Literature and Theater covers the activities in this burgeoning field. First, its history is traced year by year from 1887 to the present, in a chronology, and the introduction provides a good overview. The most important section is the dictionary, with over 600 substantial and cross-referenced entries on authors, books, and genres as well as more general ones describing the historical background, cultural features, techniques and major theatres and clubs. More reading can be found through an extensive bibliography with general works and those on specific authors. The book is thus a good place to get started, or to expanded one’s horizons, about a branch of American literature that can only grow in importance.",Literary Criticism,411.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=DV2AEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=291&source=gbs_api,,
A Few Days in the Country,Elizabeth Harrower,Text Publishing,2015-10-21,"One day, Alice said, ‘Eric Lane wants to take me to—’ For the first time, her mother attended, standing still. Eric was brought to the house, and Eric and Alice were married before there was time to say ‘knife’. How did it happen? She tried to trace it back. She was watching her mother performing for Eric, and then (she always paused here in her mind), somehow, she woke up married and in another house. Internationally acclaimed for her five brilliant novels, Elizabeth Harrower is also the author of a small body of short fiction. A Few Days in the Country brings together for the first time her stories published in Australian journals in the 1960s and 1970s, along with those from her archives—including ‘Alice’, published for the first time earlier this year in the New Yorker.

The Uncollected David Rakoff,David Rakoff,Anchor,2015-10-27,"Bestselling and Thurber Prize–winning humorist David Rakoff was one of the most original, delightfully acerbic voices of his generation. Here, in one place, is the best of his previously uncollected material—most never before published in book form. David Rakoff’s singular personality spills from every page of this witty and entertaining volume, which includes travel features, early fiction works, pop culture criticism, and transcripts of his most memorable appearances on public radio’s Fresh Air and This American Life. These writings chart his transformation from fish out of water, meekly arriving for college in 1982, to a proud New Yorker bluntly opining on how to walk properly in the city. They show his unparalleled ability to capture the pleasures of solitary pursuits like cooking and crafting, especially in times of trouble; as well as the ups and downs in the life-span of a friendship, whether it is a real relationship or an imaginary correspondence between Gregor Samsa and Dr. Seuss (co-authored with Jonathan Goldstein). Also included is his novel-in-verse Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish. By turns hilarious, incisive and deeply moving, this collection highlights the many facets of Rakoff’s huge talent and shows the arc of his remarkable career.

Fugue States,Pasha Malla,National Geographic Books,2020-04-07,"One of The Globe and Mail’s Best Books of 2017: A perfect mix of entertaining and edgy, Fugue States is a thought-provoking exploration of the first-generation Canadian experience from one of the more irreverent, inventive and daring minds writing fiction today Fugue States begins as Ash Dhar, a thirty-something writer, opens his mouth to deliver a eulogy at a funeral—the funeral for his own father, a Kashmir-born doctor. But in that moment between thought and speech, something mysterious occurs: a terrible wordless gap into which Ash falls helplessly, recovering only as the concerned faces of friends and family shock him into focus. Later, still unsettled as he sorts through his father’s belongings, Ash discovers a partially completed and baffling work of fiction set in what seems to be Kashmir. Reading his father’s words, Ash feels compelled to know more about this ancestral land—and yet he resists the impulse to visit, loathe to be a cliché, chasing self-discovery in a war-torn homeland. But Ash’s childhood friend Matt—pothead, massage therapy student and self-described “maker of memories”—has no such hesitations and goes in Ash’s place . . . with unexpected and excruciating results. Soon, Ash is forced to rescue Matt by following him to India—where he experiences a second alarming gap, one that echoes and amplifies the mysterious “fugue state” with which the novel began. Fugue States is at once a parody of clueless tourism; a knowing, uneasy look at contemporary masculinity; and a surprisingly poignant tale about the deep inchoate melancholy that abides in people who, like Ash and his father, and even Matt-the-fool, have never felt completely at home in the world.",Fiction,0.0,en,http://books.google.de/books?id=KBuNEAAAQBAJ&dq=literary+award+books&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=300&source=gbs_api,,
